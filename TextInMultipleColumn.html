    Nationwide protests are planned this weekend after Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student activist, was arrested by immigration authorities, fueling tensions between the Trump administration and student movements over immigration policy.

Khalil, 30, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the middle of the night last weekend, prompting outrage in recent days. Khalil, a Palestinian, helped lead pro-Palestinian demonstrations against the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas at Columbia University last spring.

    Protests calling for his release will be held in cities including New York City, Boston, Phoenix, Charlotte, Oklahoma City, Miami and Indianapolis on Saturday and Sunday.

The Trump administration has cited an obscure foreign-policy clause in immigration law to justify Khalil’s arrest, which allows the federal government to deport foreign nationals who deemed national security threats. The Department of Homeland Security alleges that Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”
